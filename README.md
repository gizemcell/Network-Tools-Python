# Network-Tools-Python

This repository acts as a collection of my practical implementations and study notes based on the book **"Black Hat Python"** by Justin Seitz and Tim Arnold.


## 🚀 Project Overview

* **Refactored** legacy code to ensure full compatibility with **Python 3.x**.
* **Debugged** and fixed errors encountered during execution in a modern Kali Linux environment.
* **Simulated** using local virtual machines (VMware).
